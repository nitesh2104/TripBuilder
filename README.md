# TripBuilder
Trip Builder is a web service (API) that serves as the engine for front-end websites to manage
trips for their customers.

FUNCTIONALITIES TO IMPLEMENT
- Alphabetical listing of real airports in the world
- List of flights for a trip (can be randomized from a static list)
- Adding flights to a trip
- Removing flights from a trip
- Database tables to support the API’s functionalities

KEEP IN MIND
1.
You can choose which framework/technologies you want to use
2. Code must be easy to maintain
3. You can simulate third party calls with static or mocked data
4. The flights can simply be an airport selection without a date/time for simplicity
5. Code must be written in PHP
SUPPORTING TASKS
To earn extra consideration, you can do the following
1.
Write or generate the API’s documentation or usage manual
2. Write a README.md for the project installation
3. Write a docblock for each method for IDE auto-completion
4. If possible, deloy it online for us to use
5. Build a front-end client to interact with the API for all functionalities
Note: Must not have any direct usage of the API’s classesMomentum Travel
TECHNICAL BONUSES
To earn even more consideration, you can do the following
1.
Code with optimal performance in mind without sacrificing maintainability
2. Use all PSR standards
3. Use SOLID programming principles
4. Use a hierarchical approach to your objects and models
5. Avoid tight-coupling to third party libraries (except the MVC framework itself)
